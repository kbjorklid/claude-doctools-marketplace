## Mermaid.js Diagram Creator Skill

This skill instructs Claude Code on how to create correctly formatted, rich and full-featured [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams. It does this by providing access to the official Mermaid.js documentation (which are a part of the skill), and with custom instructions. For more information, see the [README.md](./plugins/mermaid-diagrams/README.md) of the plugin.
