# Sequence Diagram Examples

## Basic sequence diagram

```mermaid-example
sequenceDiagram
    Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>John: How about you John?
    Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
    Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
    Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

    Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
    Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

## SequenceDiagram: Loops, alt and opt

```mermaid-example

        Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
        alt is sick
            Bob->>Alice: Not so good :(
        else is well
            Bob->>Alice: Feeling fresh like a daisy
        end

        opt Extra response
            Bob->>Alice: Thanks for asking
        end
    end
```

## SequenceDiagram: Message to self in loop

    Note right of John: Rational thoughts<br/>prevail...
