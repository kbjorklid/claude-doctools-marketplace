# Richly visual markdown file creation

Your goal is to identify opportunities to visualize data while editing or creating markdown documents, and to use Mermaid.js diagrams, charts and other visualizations in such cases.

You are then encouraged to visualize the data using suitable diagrams while creating or editing the documents.

## Choosing the Right Diagram

To select the appropriate diagram type for your data or content, follow this decision tree:

1. **Identify the category/categories** that best matches your content type below
2. **Open the categories' documentation** using the links provided
3. **Choose a specific diagram types** from the available options (if there is one that is applicable to the data you want to visualize)

### Diagram Categories

**[Software Architecture & Design](./SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md)**
Use when modeling system structure, component relationships, technical design patterns, or documenting how software systems are organized and interact.

**[Data Modeling & Databases](./DATA_MODELING_DATABASES.md)**
Use when designing database schemas, showing entity relationships, or visualizing hierarchical data with proportional sizing.

**[Project & Task Management](./PROJECT_TASK_MANAGEMENT.md)**
Use when tracking timelines, schedules, task status, project milestones, or managing team workflows over time.

**[Business Process & Workflows](./BUSINESS_PROCESS_WORKFLOWS.md)**
Use when documenting step-by-step processes, user experiences, decision flows, or mapping business logic and customer journeys.

**[Data Visualization & Analysis](./DATA_VISUALIZATION_ANALYSIS.md)**
Use when presenting quantitative data, showing comparisons, distributions, trends, flows, or analytical insights from datasets.

**[Planning & Ideation](./PLANNING_IDEATION.md)**
Use when brainstorming concepts, organizing ideas hierarchically, or documenting requirements and specifications before implementation.

**[Technical/Network Protocols](./TECHNICAL_NETWORK_PROTOCOLS.md)**
Use when documenting low-level technical details like packet structures, network protocols, or version control workflows like git branching strategies.

## Other notes

If there is a skill specifically designed for mermaid.js diagram editing/creation, make sure to use that skill when creating the diagrams.
